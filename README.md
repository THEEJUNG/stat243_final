Description: This package provides a function to perform MFA, and to find related quantities of interest, such as eigenvalues, factor scores, and loadings. Supplementary functions calculate information related to between-table structure. MFA is a technique used when one has multiple data sets collected about the same group of objects. This package has examples based
on a fictional wine data set: 10 different wine critics assessed the same 12 wines.
